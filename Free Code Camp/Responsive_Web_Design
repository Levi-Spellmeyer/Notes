Notes from Web Design certification course
------------------------------------------

The <figure> tag in HTML is used to encapsulate content like images, diagrams, illustrations, and code snippets, along with their captions.
This tag semantically groups the content and caption together, ensuring they're associated with each other.
For instance, if you have an image and you want to provide a caption for it, you can use the <figure> and <figcaption> tags like this:

<figure>
  <img src="example.jpg" alt="Description of image">
  <figcaption>Caption for the image.</figcaption>
</figure>

------------------------------------------

The anchor tag <a> can be embedded in a tag to connect a link to a string of text using href=""
Adding target="_blank" opens any link clicked on in a new tab

<a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Visit Example</a>

The form element is used to get information from a user like their name, email, and other details.

The input element allows you several ways to collect data from a web form. Like img elements, input elements are a void element and do not need closing tags.

In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted.
<input type="text" name="name">

To prevent a user from submitting your form when required information is missing, you need to add the required attribute to an input element.
There's no need to set a value to the required attribute. 
Instead, just add the word required to the input element, making sure there is space between it and other attributes.

input of type radio when multiple inputs share the same name attribute will make it to where only 1 input can be selected
<input type="radio" name="meal"> Breakfast
<input type="radio" name="meal"> Lunch          2 buttons only 1 can be selected and will deselect the other if clicked

The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line.
