A list comprehension is an expression that creates a list by iterating over another container.

A basic list comprehension:
  [i*2 for i in [1, 5, 10]]
  Output: [2, 10, 20]

List comprehension with if condition:
  [i*2 for i in [1, -2, 10] if i>0]
  Output: [2, 20]

List comprehension with an if and else condition:
  [i*2 if i>0 else 0 for i in [1, -2, 10]]
  Output: [2, 0, 20]





You can read an existing file with Python:
  with open("file.txt") as file:
      content = file.read()
      
You can create a new file with Python and write some text on it:
  with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
      content = file.write("Sample text")
      
You can append text to an existing file without overwriting it:
  with open("file.txt", "a") as file:
      content = file.write("More sample text")
      
You can both append and read a file with:
  with open("file.txt", "a+") as file:
      content = file.write("Even more sample text")
      file.seek(0)
      content = file.read()


You can get the documentation of a Python data type using:
help(str)
help(str.replace)
help(dict.values)

isinstance(x,type) returns true or false based on if value x matches type

*Different ways to format strings*
def person_name(first_name):
    #message ='Hi {}'.format(first_name)
    #message = f'Hi {first_name}'
    message ='Hi %s' % first_name
    return message
print(person_name('Mary'))
